61,Jeremy Scott,"I think the fashion is super serious and humor is suspect and people don't always know how to approach it.

I have a different approach to most designers."

64,Coco Chanel,"Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they notice the woman."
65,Narciso Rodriguez,"Perseverance and resilience are key. I also try to remain true to my vision.
